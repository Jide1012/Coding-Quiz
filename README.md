# beat-the-clock

I did this project because as a coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. This app ran in the browser, and featured dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.

Installation: I set up the HTML with Div elements of the Start Button, Question Container, Question, Answer Button, Choices, Player Initials, Submit Button, Timer, and High Scores. So I could access it in the CSS and Script. 


Step 2: After setting up the HTML and CSS I first did the script.js is generate the array of Characters. So I created varibles for Start Button, Question Container, Question, Answer Button, Choices, Player Initials, Submit Button, Timer, and High Scores.

Step 3: I then created the Start Game Function so when you click start game the timer will appear and added the class "hide" so the start game button will disappear. questions would appear and if you got if you got the question wrong time would go down by 10 seconds and if you got it right it would move on the the Nextquestion which was the setNextQuestion function. 

Step 4: Then I created the showQuestion function where I added the Questions. The Questions would appear and if, else statements so you if you got the question wrong time would go down by 10 seconds and if you got it right it would move on the the Nextquestion which was the setNextQuestion function. 

Step 5: Then I created the savescore function which helped me keep track of the number of correct answers the user got.

Step 6: After this was creating the EndQuiz function which ended the quiz when either the time ran out or all the questions were answers.

Step 7: The Final step was allowing the user to enter in their initials and after it was submitted their initials and score was saved in the local storage so they could see their scores in the view high scored tab.
