# beat-the-clock

I did this project because as a coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. This app ran in the browser, and featured dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.

Installation: I set up the HTML with Div's of Start Button, Question Container, Question, Answer Button, Choices, Player Initials, Submit Button, Timer, and High Scores. So I could access it in the CSS and Script. 


Step 2: After setting up the HTML and CSS I first did the script.js is generate the array of Characters. So I created varibles for Start Button, Question Container, Question, Answer Button, Choices, Player Initials, Submit Button, Timer, and High Scores.

Step 3: I then created the Start Game Function so when you clicked start game the questions would appear and if you got if you got the question wrong time would go down by 10 seconds and if you got it right it would move on the the Nextquestion which was the setNextQuestion function. 

Step 3: Then I created the showQuestion function where I added the Questions 

Step 4: Then I added Generator functions so when I click the event listener Generate Password it will run the init function which prompted me to ask all the questions for the password criteria and the Math Random function to generate a random password.

Step 5: After this it returns the password.info array which develops the variable password which helps this password show on the screen.
